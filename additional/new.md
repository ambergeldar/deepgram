# New Content

Creating a good set of carefully separated content by content type allows you to avoid duplication, which makes docs easier to maintain and review (and helps focus time on areas that are more important to expanding the business) and keeps you from accumulating technical debt. Additionally, when separated appropriately, content can be reused as building blocks to create large, more complex docs.

## Content types

Some basic content types include:

| Type | Description | 
|-|-|
| How-to | Short, barebones docs that focus on a single task, such as getting an API key. |
| Reference | Materials that support the other documentation, such as a list of supported audio types or a glossary. |
| Tutorials | Recipes for longer projects, such as implementing authentication with the SpeechEngine API. When tutorials are properly designed, you should be able to embed the how-to and references content types (perhaps in an accordion), so that users of different skill levels can find what they need without opening multiple tabs or becoming overwhelmed visually by the amount of content on the page. |
